# LinearAlgebra---Spring2019
The Linear Algebra course @ Sharif University of Technology ---Spring2019

HW2-Q3-> Having the SVD decomposition of a matrix, the best rank "X" (input) approximation of an input matrix is calculated. This is further used for quality manipulation of images.

HW2-Q5-> Implementing QR decomposition for an input matrix. Using this, the problem of least squared sum is solved. 

HW3-> Solving a specific least squared sum problem is approached using QR decomposition.
